                <p>
                    The history of white water rafting is more interesting than you may think. It's believed that it started in 1811, during a Snake River expedition. There was no training, experience, or equipment needed- and the first raft (made of rubber) wasn't invented until the 1840's! John D. Rockfeller made a hotel in Grand Teton National Park. And in the 1950's, white water rafting began attracting a lot of attention, and the hotel started offering trips. In the 1960's and 70's, white water rafting companies starting forming. And then, in 1972 the Olympics included white water rafting for the first time! It grows more and more every year, and is now a popular sport and hobby to many people.

                    Jay Evans (right) was the first coach of the U.s. Whitewater Team. He coached the team at the Olympics, where his son competed. People credit a lot of whitewater rafting popularity and succes to Jay. Coaches of current US teams still credit their leadership and experience to him. Jay graduated from Dartkouth in 1949, and then studied at the Universtiy of Zurich. After that, he got a job at the Dartmouth College Admissions Office, and was the advisor to the Ledyard Conoe Club. That is when and wehre he learned his love for the sport, and led him to coach the US Olympics team years later. [https://paddlinglife.com]

                    John Wesley Powell (left) was an American soldier, explorer, and geologist. He is reffered to as the father of whitewater rafting. Powell served in the Army during the Civil War, where he lost his right arm. He later became a professor, which led to him leading a government sponsered expedition in Wyoming. It was successful, and allowed him to do 2 more journeys in the Colorado River a few years later. It was dangerous, with harsh rapids, little to no food, and dangerous animals, his expeditions were successful. These led to more understanding and knowledge of the west and the CColorado River, and doing them inspired others to go on similar adventures.

                    There are many whitewater rafting locations in the world, and all are famous for their own reasons. 
                    One is in Chile, and called the Terminator. Its known to be the "biggest and baddest." Many professionals even say they refuse to attempt this river.

                    Big Drops 2 and 3, are located in America. They span from the Colorado River through Cataract Canyon, Utah. They have big drops, and are very fast. The waves are said to be bigger than those in the Grand Canyon.
                    Another in America is Lava falls. This starts in the Colorado River, and end in the Grand Canyon, Arizona. It is the biggest rapid in this canon, and falls a total of 37 feet. And it rated at the highest level of difficulty.

                    The last one I will mention is in Nepal and called God's House. In early October, you can find some of the biggest volum rapids in the world. This river has huge waves, and dips and holes, and you're likely to go flipping and flying.
